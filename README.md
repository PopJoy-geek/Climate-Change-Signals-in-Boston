## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes a decade of daily weather observations from Boston, Massachusetts to identify and quantify the local impacts of global warming. The investigation focuses on key climate indicators that provide robust evidence of a changing climate system.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. Asymmetric Warming in Coldest Months
- **Finding**: Boston's coldest month (January) shows a significant warming trend
- **Significance**: Winter warming provides the clearest signal of greenhouse gas-induced climate change
- **Mechanism**: The "blanket effect" is most effective at inhibiting heat loss during cold seasons

### 2. Decreasing Annual Temperature Range  
- **Finding**: The difference between summer highs and winter lows is narrowing
- **Significance**: Indicates disproportionate warming in colder seasons
- **Climate Link**: Consistent with global "asymmetric warming" patterns

### 3. Precipitation Extremization
- **Finding**: Increased volatility in annual rainfall with dramatic year-to-year swings
- **Pattern**: "Feast or famine" cycle with exceptionally wet years followed by severe drought
- **Physics Basis**: Warmer atmosphere holds more moisture (Clausius-Clapeyron relationship)

### 4. Intensifying Maximum Precipitation Events
- **Finding**: Record-breaking monthly rainfall peaks in 2018 (235.1 mm) and 2021 (256.0 mm)
- **Trend**: "Intermittent but intensifying pulse" pattern in extreme rainfall
- **Impact**: Increased flood risks and water management challenges

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Data Source
- **Dataset**: Boston Weather Data 2013-2023
- **Metrics**: Daily temperature (°C) and precipitation (mm) records
- **Origin**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/your-dataset-link)
